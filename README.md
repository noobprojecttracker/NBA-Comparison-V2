# NBA-Comparison-V2

I created this project because I wanted to have the ability to compare any 2 NBA player's statistics with ease. I utilized Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create this project. It is still a work in progress as I am always looking to improve upon my projects by perfecting the code and adding more features.

In summary, you can enter 2 different players in their respective input fields, with the help of a responsive dropdown menu that filters out players whose names do not include the letters you are typing. Once you select them, and click the "compare" button, some of their stats will load in charts in the bottom. The first chart compares both of the players PPG, APG, and RPG, and the second chart compares their shooting percentages.

The below image is an updated screenshot of what it looks like to compare Jayson Tatum and Jimmy Butler's stats.
